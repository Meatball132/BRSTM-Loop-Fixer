# BRSTM-Loop-Fixer
Small utility tool that takes loop points and converts them to multiples of the BRSTM frame size so custom BRSTMs loop properly.

Usage:
`brstm_loop_fixer Loop_Start Loop_End`

## When do I need to use this?
I recommend using Skawo's BRSTM Encoder to convert WAV files to BRSTM files: https://github.com/skawo/BRSTM-Encoder

The latest version of Skawo's software already aligns loop points automatically. However, if you're using another tool to create your BRSTMs and you're having issues with looping, this might be the solution!
