# BRSTM-Loop-Fixer
CLI tool that takes loop points and converts them to multiples of the BRSTM frame size so custom BRSTMs loop properly.

Usage:
`brstm_loop_fixer Loop_Start Loop_End`

I recommend using Skawo's BRSTM Encoder to convert WAV files to BRSTM files: https://github.com/skawo/BRSTM-Encoder
